                <p class="center">Liquidity risk management is a crucial but often overlooked element of running a successful business.  One of the key values of risk management is minimising the cost of distress, and no more so than in liquidity risk management.  Even the most profitable strategies require cashflow management, and Seventh Wave provides the models, forecasts to insight to ensure cashflow does not get in the way of profitability.</p>

            <p class="center">
                Studies show that excellent risk management driven from the top adds tangible value to companies <!-(read more here)->. We strive to turn clients' risk management into a value creation center, a process which starts from the very top.
                Risk is an inevitable result of any return-generating venture, but failing to command those risks leaves value on the table at best, and even has potential to destroy value.
                We engage with senior management to identify key financial risks inherent in our clients' business and analyse the key risk/return profiles.
                After helping clients to understand and articulate their business's risk appetites, we design and implement the systems and processes necessary to mitigate, monitor and modulate key risks.
                By re-engaging with the risks in your business, we can help you recapture value and drive the business forward with a risk-awareness that will maximise value whatever your long-term goals.

                We can advise you on key competencies, and can source, filter and train any new hires you may need, whilst providing them with mentors to lean upon in their new role.
